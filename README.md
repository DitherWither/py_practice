What Sums did I do?
-------------------

 - 1 - 21 were done with a few exceptions
  
 - I don't know how to do question 10.

 - Question 12 and 13 have the same solution in python.
  
 - The answer for C would have been
    ```
   x = x + y
   
   // x - y is just old x was now as we added old y to old x earlier
   y = x - y
    
   // now that y is old x, subtracting it from temporary x
   // will result in old y or new x
   x = x - y 
   ```

 - Question 19 and 11 have the same answer in python as I am using `min()` and `max()` 
   functions

 - For question 20, I am creating 2 solutions as the question wasn't clear
   whether absolute difference was required or I just had to print an error
   if the difference was below 0
